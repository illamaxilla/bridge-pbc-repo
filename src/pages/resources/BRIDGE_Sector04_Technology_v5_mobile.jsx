  summary:'Ghana\'s technology sector presents a structural paradox that is both urgent and solvable. On one side: 70% internet penetration, $68M in 2024 startup funding — a 152% increase year-over-year — and over 100 active tech hubs. On the other: 60% of that capital flows to fintech alone, female founders receive less than 1% of total funding, and Series A is virtually absent in-country, forcing growth-stage startups to relocate to Nairobi or Lagos to survive.',
  summary2:'BRIDGE enters this sector not as a passive investor but as the operator that simultaneously closes the Series A gap and builds the market infrastructure around which a self-sustaining innovation economy can organise. The Kejetia Digital Platform — BRIDGE\'s flagship infrastructure venture — is the proof-of-concept that positions BRIDGE as Ghana\'s leading market digitization operator. From that anchor, the BRIDGE Growth Fund, Tech Talent Bridge Programme, and sector-specific equity portfolios build a diversified technology investment ecosystem.',
  summary3:'The human impact is direct: every growth-stage company BRIDGE capitalises is a retention infrastructure investment for Ghana\'s next cohort of technical graduates. The Kejetia anchor alone brings 10,000+ market vendors into the formal digital economy, generating the transaction data that makes every downstream BRIDGE portfolio company more bankable. Technology is not one of 12 sectors — it is the operating system of all 12.',
  quote:'"The gap is not access — it is utilization, commercialization, and scale. Ghana needs growth capital, diaspora expertise, and market platform infrastructure that converts a world-class foundation into durable economic output."',

Mobile money infrastructure that the world studies. And virtually no Series A capital in-country. The companies that reach growth stage face a structural wall: the capital to go from traction to scale does not exist domestically, and taking it from foreign investors means ceding control, relocating headquarters, and building for a foreign investor's exit timeline rather than Ghana's long-term technology ecosystem.</p>
            <p style={{fontFamily:F.body,fontSize:'15px',lineHeight:1.85,color:C.ink,fontWeight:300,marginBottom:'14px'}}>The connectivity picture compounds the capital problem. National internet penetration of 70% collapses to 28% in rural areas. 4G coverage reaches 60% of the population, but only 15% actively use it. Fixed broadband penetration sits below 0.7%. The infrastructure is built; the activation is not. And the talent pipeline — 3,200 computer science graduates and 8,000 bootcamp completions annually — produces more capacity than Ghana's formal tech employment market can absorb, so an estimated 2,800 tech workers emigrate every year for remote work or physical relocation. Ghana's ecosystem trains talent for other economies to capture.</p>
